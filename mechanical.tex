\section{Overview}
\label{sect:intro}
In response to MacDonald, Detwiller and Associates Ltd's (MDA) Request for Proposal (RFP), this report outlines the mechanical aspect of the project. This section describes the mechanical aspect of each subsystems, \Cref{sect:requirements} describes the detailed functional and performance requirements based on the mechanical aspect of the design. \Cref{sect:tradeoff} shows trade studies for the mechanical design choices at the current stage, and \Cref{sect:architecture} will display physical layout of the system via series of diagrams. Finally, \Cref{sect:mass} outlines the detailed mass budget of the physical architecture.

The following subsystems have been identified:
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Locomotion}: Responsible for navigating around the Outpost and moving modules
\item \textbf{Data Handling and Processing}: Responsible for collecting and processing data
\item \textbf{Thermal Control}: Responsible for maintaining operational temperature ranges
\item \textbf{Power}: Responsible for power infrastructure and power supply
\item \textbf{End Effector}: Responsible for interaction between the system and the environment
\item \textbf{Sensor}: Responsible for monitoring the space environment and the robotic system
\item \textbf{Frame}: Responsible for providing structural support and protection to the robotic system
\end{enumerate}

\Cref{table:mechoverview} gives a general summary of the mechanical requirements for each subsystem.

\section{Trade Studies}
\label{sect:tradeoff}
\subsection{Architecture}
\label{sect:architectureto}
To perform operations such as Outpost reconfiguration, and capturing and berthing of free flyer, the robotic system needs to have wide workspace range. The arm design that was used for Canadarm and Canadarm2 is capable of these operations. Using this design as reference, three alternative architectures are proposed. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{4 DOF robotic arm with 4 booms and 3 end effector}\\
The first design has 14 joints as shown in \Cref{fig:14dof} below. The two booms at the bottom act as legs to maneuver around the Outpost. The end effectors connected to each legs can grapple to the Outpost and to the free flyer vehicles. There is a smaller arm connects to the elbow joints of the legs, which has 7 DOF to perform inspection, maintenance and repair of the Outpost.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{14dof}
\caption{Sketch of 14DOF arm}
\label{fig:14dof}
\end{figure}
}
\item{\textbf{7 DOF robotic arm with 2 telescopic booms and 2 end effectors}\\
This architecture has two telescopic booms that would be extended once the robotic system is unstowed. The telescopic booms are extended by first connecting both end effectors on the Outpost and allowing the shoulder joint to freely rotate. Then, the elbow joint will rotate and extend the telescopic boom and two booms will extend separately.

The end effectors can grapple to Outpost to perform Outpost reconfiguration as well as free flying vehicles for capture and berthing. The end effectors can also connect to tools that are used for Outpost inspection and maintenance. The sketch of the architecture is shown in \Cref{fig:7dof} below.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{7dof}
\caption{Sketch of 7DOF arm}
\label{fig:7dof}
\end{figure}
}
\item{\textbf{14 DOF robotic arm with truss rail, 2 booms and 2 end effectors}\\
As shown in \Cref{fig:14dof_truss} below, this design is composed of two parts. The first part is a 8 DOF arm with a truss rail and two booms. The end effectors can grapple to the Outpost to maneuver the robotic arm around the Outpost and perform Outpost reconfiguration. The end effectors can also grapple to free flyingr vehicles for capture and berthing operations. For inspection, maintenance and repair operations, two end effectors will be fixed on the Outpost and the truss rail between two elbow joints will act as guides for the fine arm.

The fine arm has 6 DOF and can move on the truss rail to perform inspection, maintenance and repair operations. Different tools can be attached to the end of the fine arm for specific tasks.

\subsection{Material of Frame}
\label{sect:materialto}
The material of the frame is directly related to the mass and shape of the system. Certain materials are too brittle to manufacture in desired shapes, and will affect the architecture of the system. As the material heavily affects mechanical aspects of the design, trade study on the material of frame was conducted. Material with low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high strength are desired for the frame of the system. Commonly used materials in the space industry include carbon fiber, aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium. Each material has numerous variations with different properties and name. A trade study between four materials were conducted in table below.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Trade Study for type of Thermal Control System}

\textbf{Density (\si{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed})}	&	
1.8	&	2.81	&	8	&	4.43	\\\hline
\textbf{Ultimate Tensile Strength (\si{\mega\pascal})}	&
3450 to 5520	&	572	&	505	&	900 to 100	\\\hline
\textbf{Thermal Coefficient of Expansion (\si{\micro\metre\per\metre\per\kelvin})}	&	
-0.4 to -0.75	&	23.6	&	17.3	&	8.6	\\\hline
\textbf{Young's Modulus (\si{\giga\pascal})}	&
220 to 448	&	71.7	&	193 to 200	&	113.8	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:materialto}
\end{table}

The specific properties of carbon fiber will vary with orientation and volume of the fibers and type of resin used. Aerospace grade carbon fiber, which has high stiffness to weight ratio, were selected for comparison. Other space robotic arms, such as Canadarm, Canadarm2, and ERA are made of carbon fiber as well. In general, carbon fiber is much lighter than titanium and stainless steel, have lower magnitude of thermal coefficient of expansion, and higher young’s modulus and tensile strength. Overall, aerospace grade carbon fiber is the most desirable option out of the four.

\subsection{Thermal Control System}
\label{sect:thermalto}
To ensure that temperatures of the subsystems are within their operating ranges, a thermal regulation system is required. In order to meet the requirement \textbf{TC-P-01}, which lists allowable temperature ranges, a trade study was conducted between active thermal control system (ATCS) and passive thermal control system (PTCS). ATCS makes use of various heaters and coolers to control the temperature within the system, and PTCS makes use of insulation to reduce heat transfer and surface coatings which modify the thermal or optical properties of the surface. The two types of thermal control system are compared in \Cref{table:thermalto}.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Trade Study for type of Thermal Control System}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{6.2cm}|P{6.2cm}|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{ACTS}	&	\textbf{PCTS}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|}
\textbf{System Complexity}	&
\textcolor{red}{More complex due to electrical system and/or software in the system}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Less complex due to the lack of electrical system or software}	\\\hline
\textbf{System Reliability}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Can be manually controlled in the case of control system malfunction}\newline	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Allows for more precise temperature control}\newline \textcolor{orange}{Needs repair if heating and cooling elements break down}	&
\textcolor{red}{No control system required for passive control}\newline \textcolor{orange}{Range of control is limited to materials}\newline \textcolor{OliveGreen}{More immune to failures due to lower complexity}	\\\hline
\textbf{System Efficiency}	&
\textcolor{orange}{Can be placed on standby mode to save power}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Limited power usage\newline Efficient in reducing heat transfer}	\\\hline
\textbf{Cost}	&
\textcolor{red}{Higher due to mechanical and electrical parts}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Lower as little or no installation required, no electrical or mechanical parts}	\\\hline
\textbf{Mass}	&
\textcolor{red}{Greater mass due to mechanical parts}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Lower mass, blankets and pain coatings weigh less than mechanical parts}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:thermalto}
\end{table}
In \Cref{sect:materialto}, carbon fibre was selected as the frame material. Therefore, assuming the surface of the system is made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer, the expected surface temperature when it is fully exposed to sunlight is approximately 390 K. (\Cref{app:tempcalc}) The exact temperature will vary with fibre volume fraction, as well as type of the polymer. Although the maximum temperature is within the operational range of several components, it exceeds the operation range of sensitive components like electronics. Therefore, it is desirable to use multiple thermal systems to reduce the temperatures. Using only passive system and increasing redundancy does not improve the system reliability. Using only the active system and increasing the redundancy requires significant cost and mass. Therefore, it is decided that the system will use combination of active and passive thermal control system for efficient temperature control. Further calculation shows that coating the surface with white paint reduces the absorptivity/emissivity ratio and reduces the expected surface temperature further.

\subsection{Power Storage}
\label{sect:powerto}
In order to provide the robotic system with power to run during contingencies, a power storage subsystem is required. A trade study of the two most commonly used rechargeable batteries in space, Li-ion and NiH$_2$ batteries,
 is conducted in \Cref{table:powerto}.
\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Trade Study for type of Power Storage}

\end{tabular}
\label{table:powerto}
\end{table}
Li-ion batteries are able to provide much more energy with a smaller mass and volume than NiH$_2$ batteries. Li-ion batteries are also operable over a much larger temperature range than NiH$_2$ batteries. Although Li-ion batteries can endure much less charge cycles than NiH$_2$, this would not be a huge problem as the batteries will only be used in contingencies, and will not be subjected to discharging and recharging on a frequent basis. The most major drawback related to the use of Li-ion batteries is the short life span, which would mean that it has to be replaced fairly frequently.

\subsection{End Effector}
\label{sect:endeffectorto}
In order to interact with the external subsystems situated around EML2, including the Outpost, astronauts and other modules during various operations, an end effector subsystem is required to build connections with the Outpost and other modules. And the interface established by the end effector shall capable of providing power and data connections to and from the robotic system.

As a result of those criteria, two potential end effector models are listed and compared below:

\textbf{Three fingers-three petals End Effector}: There are two main subassemblies of this end effector: an active mechanism, which consists of a motor driven lead screw that would accurate the linkages between the three finger and three petals; a passive structure, whose geometry will allow it to be constrained by the linkages and therefore establishing a rigid interface.	\\
\textbf{Steel cable-snared End Effector}: This end effector system consists of the snaring and rigidizing subassembly inside the shell, and four latch/umbilical subassemblies outside the shell, which are responsible for the rigidizing loop and the connecting loop after the fine positioning for latching and connecting operation is reached.
\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{6.35cm}|P{6.35cm}|}
\hline
	&
\textbf{Three fingers-three petals End Effector}	&
\textbf{Steel cable-snared End Effector}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|}
\textbf{System Complexity}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Two main subassemblies\newline Can accomplish capturing, rigidizing and connection by only one actuator. \cite{CJME_EE}}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Two main subassemblies\newline An orbit replaceable unit, end effector can be easily replaced or repaired on orbit \cite{CJME_EE}}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Accuracy}	&

\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Has a strong capability of misalignment tolerance\newline Has enormous capability of soft capture \cite{CJME_EE}}	\\\hline

\textcolor{orange}{Maximum \SI{50}{\kilo\gram} \cite{orbital_capture}}	\\\hline
\textbf{Volume Occupied}	&
\textcolor{red}{Relatively large: maximum circumradius \SI{350}{\milli\metre} to \SI{500}{\milli\metre} \cite{CJME_EE}\cite{orbital_capture}}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Small: maximum circumradius \SI{280}{\milli\metre} \cite{CJME_EE}}	\\\hline
\textbf{Power Required}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Low, only one actuator required \cite{CJME_EE}}	&

\textcolor{orange}{Large at a low speed \cite{ERA_EE}}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:endeffector}
\end{table}
According to this comparison, the second design - Steel cable-snared End Effector is more suitable for our project. And in addition to those advantages listed, the Steel cable-snared End Effector is a proven technology, which has been applied on existing projects like the European Robotic Arm (ERA).

\subsection{Locomotion - Motor type}
\label{motorto}
In order to efficiently navigate around the Outpost and move astronauts as well as other modules to their desired destination, a proper types of motors need to be selected for the locomotion subsystem. The chosen motor shall be able to fit in the mass/volume constraints, and shall capable of providing enough torque to the system. Three models have been considered – Stepper Motor, Brushless DC Motor and Brush DC Motor, which are compared in \Cref{table:motorto}:

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Trade Study for Type of Motor}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{4.1cm}|P{4.1cm}|P{4.1cm}|}
\hline
	&
\textbf{Stepper Motor}	&	
\textbf{Brushless DC Motor}	&
\textbf{Brush DC Motor}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Torque Capability}	&
\textcolor{orange}{High torque/power ratio at low speed and low power \cite{ESA_motor}}\newline\textcolor{red}{Short term-peak torque capability is limited by magnetic saturation\newline Low angular torque stiffness\newline  Noisy, creating significant speed ripple and microgravity disturbances \cite{ESA_motor}}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Torque/power is  high\newline Given torque can be obtained at any working speed, if power allows\newline Significant short-term peak torque capability, with a peak value which can be more than five times the nominal demand\newline Less noise\cite{ESA_motor}}	& 
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Similar to the Brushless DC Motor, with lower power consumption \cite{ESA_motor}}\newline\textcolor{red}{Brushes have major drawbacks in space environments (i.e. disruptive voltages after a dormant period) \cite{ESA_motor}}   \\\hline
\textbf{Electric Driver Complexity}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Simplest\newline Resulting incremental stepping motion matches with many mechanisms requirements \cite{ESA_motor}}	&
\textcolor{red}{More complex than “simplest” stepper motor driver \cite{ESA_motor}}\newline\textcolor{orange}{Complexity will be reduced if a position exists in system  \cite{ESA_motor}}  & 
\textcolor{red}{Similar to the brushless DC motor \cite{ESA_motor}} 	\\\hline
\textbf{Mass/ Volume Required}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Usually does not require a dedicated position sensor \cite{ESA_motor}}	&
\textcolor{red}{Always needs a position sensor \cite{ESA_motor}}   & 
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Mass/size is relatively smaller than brushless DC Motor\cite{ESA_motor}}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:motorto}
\end{table}
From the trade study, the brushless DC motor has a better performance than the other two compared models, and has a significant advantage at the torque capability. Also, brushless DC motor has been considered for previous space arm robot project \cite{ERA_motor}, which will decrease its development risk. Therefore, a brushless DC motor is chosen to be used on the locomotion subsystem.

\subsection{Locomotion - Joint type}
\label{sect:jointto}
As a major part of the locomotion subsystem, the joints utilize rotation of the motors to accomplish the motion of robotic arm. Two different joint structures that used in reference designs are inline joint and offset joint. Inline joint is used in European Robotic Arm and offset joint is used in Canadarm2. Depend on the tasks that two arms need to perform, both joint structures have advantages and disadvantages.
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Trade Study for type of Joint}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.5cm}|P{6.35cm}|P{6.35cm}|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{Inline Joint}	&
	\textbf{Offset Joint}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Operation Complexity}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{No joint collision risk, components are in the same plane.}	&
\textcolor{red}{Add complexity to task due to possibility of joint collision [comp]}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Range}	&
\textcolor{red}{Limited mobility; limited motor rotational range.}	&
\textcolor{OliveGreen}{The arm can maneuver more readily over large areas by “stepping over the elbow”; large motor rotational range[comp]}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:jointto}
\end{table}

The major task for Canadarm2 was to assemble the ISS. By having offset joints, the joint can rotate in larger range and enable the arm to have more flexible motion. \Cref{table:jointrange} in \Cref{app:jointrange} shows the joint motion range for Canadarm2 and ERA \cite{arm_comp}. As the robotic system on the Outpost needs to perform reconfiguration operation, it is important to have large range of motion to maneuver the Outpost module. Therefore the offset joint structure is chosen for the locomotion subsystem.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sect:architecture}
The physical architecture of the robotic system is displayed in the figure below. The architecture is designed from the trade-offs discussed: the system will have 7 DOF, 2 telescopic carbon fiber booms. The number of DOF and material of the frame were derived from \Cref{sect:architectureto,sect:materialto} respectively. Telescoping booms increases the reach of the system at the cost of an increase in mass compared to a boom of similar length.

\Cref{fig:stowedarm,fig:openedarm} shows the system in stowed and deployed configurations respectively.Three joints (red) and sensor units (green) are placed at the end of the booms, and power unit (purple) and data handling unit (yellow) are placed on the middle joint. End effector subsystem (orange) is located at the end of each arm, and sensors are located at each joints to obtain thermal, mechanical, and visual data. Finally, thermal control subsystem is located inside the frame (white) and cables and distribution channels connecting subsystems are placed inside the frame.

\section{Mass Budget}
\label{sect:mass}
\Cref{table:mass} outlines the estimated mass budget for each of the subsystems. The estimates are justified below.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Mass Budget}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Subsystem}	&	\textbf{Mass(kg)}	&	\textbf{Percentage}	&	\textbf{Margin}\\\midrule
\textbf{Locomotion}						&	141.75	&	45\%&	30\%\\
\textbf{Data Handling \& Processing}	&	15.75	&	5\%	&	30\%\\
\textbf{Thermal Control}				&	12.6	&	4\%	&	30\%\\
\textbf{Power}							&	6.3		&	2\%	&	30\%\\
\textbf{End Effector}					&	69.3	&	22\%&	30\%\\
\textbf{Sensors}						&	6.3		&	2\%	&	30\%\\
\textbf{Frame}							&	31.5	&	10\%&	30\%\\
\textbf{Cables}							&	31.5	&	10\%&	30\%\\\hline
\textbf{Total}	&	\textbf{315}	&	\textbf{100\%}	&	\textbf{30\%}	\\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{table:mass}
\end{table}

\textbf{Total Mass}: Mass constraint of \SI{450}{\kilo\gram} \cite{RFP}, and mass margin is 30\%.

\textbf{Locomotion}: Based in ERA joint percentages \cite{ERA_joints}, adjusted as electronics and cabling are accounted for separately. 

\textbf{Data Handling \& Processing}: The appropriate mass percentage for this subsystem was determined based on the design of other space systems and their mass breakdowns. \cite{LISA_budget, TUD_mass, NASA_microrover}

\textbf{Thermal Control}: The passive thermal control components are extremely lightweight, and based on other space system designs \cite{TUD_mass}, it was determined that the thermal control subsystem will account for a relatively low portion of the mass budget.

\textbf{Power}: Batteries should not weigh less than \SI{6.3}{\kilo\gram}, especially for the purpose of this robotic system as an emergency, temporary power source. (\Cref{sect:power})

\textbf{End Effector}: Typical end effectors weigh a maximum of \SI{50}{\kilo\gram}, including cabling, cameras, and electrical equipment. (\Cref{sect:endeffector})

\textbf{Sensors}: Cameras and lighting fixtures for inspection account for the majority of the weight for this subsystem. These components typically weigh about \SI{500}{\gram} to \SI{1}{\kilo\gram}, whereas other sensors are relatively insignificant in terms of mass.  \cite{cameras}

\textbf{Frame}: Using designs for a telescopic boom \cite{ESM_telescopic}, and referencing Canadarm \cite{IEEE_Carm}, it was determined that the booms will weigh about \SI{15}{\kilo\gram} to \SI{20}{\kilo\gram} each.

\textbf{Cables}: The mass of cabling is typically about 10\% of the total system mass for manipulators for systems similar to the Canadarm \cite{IEEE_RMSperformance}.
