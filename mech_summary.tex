The following document outlines the mechanical aspects of the robotic system and subsystems involved in the development and maintenance of a future lunar Outpost. Firstly, an overview of the mechanical aspects of each system is briefly tabulated and described. Then, the subsystem mechanical requirements are clearly defined, and sub-categorized appropriately into functional, or performance requirements. Next, the major mechanical trade-offs are discussed, including the architecture type, frame material, thermal control system, power storage, end-effector, locomotion, and joints. From the trade studies, a 7 DOF arm was selected, with carbon-fibre booms, a hybrid thermal control system, a lithium-ion battery as an emergency power backup, steel-cable snared end-effectors, brushless DC motors, and offset joints. A more detailed figure of the robotic architecture is then illustrated, showing locations and layout of the major components in a simplified figure. Finally, the mass budget of the system was tabulated and briefly justified.
